Sink is a tool that allows you to compare multiple directories, take snapshots
of their state, and compare the states. It also provides commands to create
logical links between files to do micro changes management.

Use cases
=========

Sink can be very handy for the following uses cases:

 *) Compare multiple versions of a source tree (replacing 'diff -r')
 *) Manually merge directories outside of a revision control system
 *) Synchronize files belonging to different directories
 *) Track changes in a specific directory
 *) Backup and deploy directory-wide changes
 *) Keep shared files up-to-date

Comparing directories
---------------------

Imagine you have 3 different versions of a specific source tree. In this
example, we'll simply checkout three different revisions of the 'sink'
development tree:

>    $ git clone git://github.com/sebastien/sink.git sink-r1
>    $ git clone git://github.com/sebastien/sink.git sink-r2
>    $ git clone git://github.com/sebastien/sink.git sink-r3

and we compare the three directories:

>    $ sink diff sink-r1 sink-r2 sink-r3
>    No differences

as the three directories are the same, we'll put them to different revisions:

>    $ cd sink-r1 ; git checkout -b older a17609eaabbf8feb3b480d46cb972df0599755fe ; cd ..
>    $ cd sink-r2 ; git checkout -b old   9e0e6a476f41f0de685d2c92e142b206b46810e4 ; cd ..

and we can now compare the directories:

>    sink diff sink-r1 sink-r2 sink-r3
>    00  ! [+][+] .hgtags
>    01 [=][-][-] DESIGN
>    02 [=][<][<] Makefile
>    03 [=][-][-] NOTES
>    04 -!--!-[+] README
>    05 [=][-][-] ROADMAP
>    06 [=][>][<] TODO
>    07 -!-[+][+] setup.py
>    08 -!-[+]-!- Documentation/DESIGN.txt
>    09 -!-[+]-!- Documentation/MANUAL.txt
>    10 [=][=][-] Resources/epydoc.css
>    11 -!-[+][+] Scripts/sink
>    12 [=][-][-] Sources/sink/Sink.py
>    13 [=][-][-] Sources/sink/Tracking.py
>    14 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/linking.py
>    15 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/main.py
>    16 -!--!-[+] Sources/sink/snapshot.py
>    17 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/tracking.py

sink has found differences and indicates them in the form of a table, where the
legend can be found in the 'sink --help diff' command:

>    [=] no changes         [+] file added           [>] changed/newer
>                           [-] file removed         [<] changed/older
>                           -!- file missing

we can have a list of all the files that were added in 'sink-r2' and 'sink-r3'
by showing only the added files:

>    $ sink diff +a sink-r1 sink-r2 sink-r3
>    00 -!-[+][+] .hgtags
>    01 -!--!-[+] README
>    02 -!-[+][+] setup.py
>    03 -!-[+]-!- Documentation/DESIGN.txt
>    04 -!-[+]-!- Documentation/MANUAL.txt
>    05 -!-[+][+] Scripts/sink
>    06 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/linking.py
>    07 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/main.py
>    08 -!--!-[+] Sources/sink/snapshot.py
>    09 -!-[+][+] Sources/sink/tracking.py

and the output is 'cut' friendly:

>    $ sink diff +a sink-r1 sink-r2 sink-r3 | cut -d' ' -f3-
>    .hgtags
>    README
>    setup.py
>    Documentation/DESIGN.txt
>    Documentation/MANUAL.txt
>    Scripts/sink
>    Sources/sink/linking.py
>    Sources/sink/main.py
>    Sources/sink/snapshot.py
>    Sources/sink/tracking.py

you can also compare individual changes between all the versions. Let's
see the changes made to the 'Sources/sink/tracking.py' file between 'sink-r2'
and 'sink-r3':

>    $ sink diff sink-r2 sink-r3
>    0 -!-[+] README
>    1 [=][<] TODO
>    2 [=][-] Documentation/DESIGN.txt
>    3 [=][-] Documentation/MANUAL.txt
>    4 [=][-] Resources/epydoc.css
>    5 [=][<] Sources/sink/linking.py
>    6 [=][<] Sources/sink/main.py
>    7 -!-[+] Sources/sink/snapshot.py
>    8 [=][<] Sources/sink/tracking.py

the number of the file in the table is 5, so we pass it to sink '-d' option:

>   $ sink diff -d5 sink-r2 sink-r3
>   >> gvimdiff sink-r2/Sources/sink/linking.py sink-r3/Sources/sink/linking.py

this starts up 'gvimdiff', showing the differences between the files. This is a
great way to do a merge outside of a revision control system.

Synchronizing directories
-------------------------

So taking our previous example, let's imaging we'd like to synchronize 'sink-r1'
so that it is exactly the same as 'sink-r3'.

We start by showing the added or modified files:

>    $ sink +a +m sink-r1 sink-r3
>    00 -!-[+] .hgtags
>    01 [=][<] Makefile
>    02 -!-[+] README
>    03 [=][<] TODO
>    04 -!-[+] setup.py
>    05 -!-[+] Scripts/sink
>    06 -!-[+] Sources/sink/linking.py
>    07 -!-[+] Sources/sink/main.py
>    08 -!-[+] Sources/sink/snapshot.py
>    09 -!-[+] Sources/sink/tracking.py

we then pipe the result to 'cut' and 'xargs', first to create the directories
that may not exist, and then to copy the files

>    $ sink +a +m sink-r1 sink-r3 | cut -d' ' -f3- | xargs dirname | sort | uniq| xargs mkdir -p
>    $ sink +a +m sink-r1 sink-r3 | cut -d' ' -f3- | xargs -I FILE cp sink-r3/FILE sink-r1/FILE

and we make sure the directories are the same:

>    $ sink sink-r1 sink-r3
>    0 [=][-] DESIGN
>    1 [=][-] NOTES
>    2 [=][-] ROADMAP
>    3 [=][-] Resources/epydoc.css
>    4 [=][-] Sources/sink/Sink.py
>    5 [=][-] Sources/sink/Tracking.py

we see that we have files to remove from 'sink-r1', so let's do it:

>    $ sink +r sink-r1 sink-r3 | cut -d' ' -f3 | xargs -I FILE rm sink-r1/FILE
>    $ sink sink-r1 sink-r3
>    No changes found.

and we've done the synchronization right. This may look a little bit verbose,
but it's Unix's design philosophy -- have simple tools that do thing, and then
integrate with other tools to do higher-level operations. 

Tracking changes made to a directory
------------------------------------

Let's say you've just downloaded 'fltk', a cross-platform C++ widget library and
you'd like to install it in /usr/local -- but you want to keep a receipt of the
installed files.

First, get fltk, and compile it

>    $ wget 'http://ftp.easysw.com/pub/fltk/1.1.9/fltk-1.1.9-source.tar.bz2'
>    $ tar fvxj fltk-1.1.9-source.tar.bz2
>    $ cd fltk-1.1.9 ; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local ; make

now we take a snapshot of '/usr/local'

>    $ sink snap /usr/local > usr-local.snap

you can now install fltk and see the changes:

>    $ sudo make install
>    $ sink usr-local.snap /usr/local
>    000 -!-[+] bin/fltk-config
>    001 -!-[+] lib/libfltk.a
>    002 -!-[+] lib/libfltk_forms.a
>    003 -!-[+] lib/libfltk_gl.a
>    004 -!-[+] lib/libfltk_images.a
>    005 -!-[+] include/FL/Enumerations.H
>    006 -!-[+] include/FL/Fl.H
>    007 -!-[+] include/FL/Fl_Adjuster.H
>    008 -!-[+] include/FL/Fl_BMP_Image.H
>    009 -!-[+] include/FL/Fl_Bitmap.H
>    ...
>    434 -!-[+] share/doc/fltk/examples/pixmaps/whiteking_3.xbm
>    435 -!-[+] share/doc/fltk/examples/pixmaps/whiteking_4.xbm
>    436 -!-[+] share/doc/fltk/examples/pixmaps/yellow.xpm
>    437 -!-[+] share/doc/fltk/examples/pixmaps/yellow_bomb.xpm

now you could create a receipt for the installation:

>   $ sink +a +m usr-local.snap /usr/local | cut -d' ' -f3- | xargs -IFILE echo /usr/local/FILE > fltk.receipt

or create a tarball with the installed files:

>   $ tar cvfj fltk-1.1.9-i386.tar.bz2 `sink +a +m usr-local.snap /usr/local | cut -d' ' -f3- | xargs -IFILE echo /usr/local/FILE`


Backuping your data
-------------------

Let's imagine you just got a new slice on Linode, and you'd like to start doing
its configuration. You'd start by creating a snapshot of '/etc':

$ sudo sink -s /etc > etc-`date  +'%Y%m%d'`.snap

you'd then do your modifications and list the changes you made:

>    $ sudo sink etc-20090929.snaphsot /etc
>    000 [=][>] apt/sources.list
>    001 [=][>] passwd
>    002 [=][>] group
>    ...

and make a tarball out of your changes:

>   $ tar cvfj node-configured.tar.bz2 `sink +a +m etc-20090929.snap /etc | cut -d' ' -f3- | xargs -IFILE echo etc/FILE`

you'll then be able to simply apply the same configuration to a new node by
doing this:

>   $ cd / ; sudo tar fvxj ~/node-configured.tar.bz2

Keeping shared files up-to-date
-------------------------------

Sink's '-l' mode comes in handy when you'd like to use symlinks but you can't
(because you put your files under revision control, etc).

Let's put this in context: let's say you're just began working on a new Web application
('mywebapp') and that you start by using a couple of files ('reset.css',
'base.css', 'sidebarlayout.css') from your 'mycsslibs' project.

You'll probably simply copy the files to 'mywebapp', but if you update them in
'mywebapp' you'll have to propagate back the changes to 'mycsslib', and you
might forget to do so.

You might also just create symlinks instead of copying the files -- but your SCM
system is likely to consider the file as a symlink, so your 'mywebapp' will
depend on having 'mycsslibs' installed at the right location.

Using Sink '-l' mode you can have most of the advantages of symlinks, while
making it easy to propagate and merge back changes.

Let's take a tour of the options, assuming 'mywebapp' and 'mycsslibs' are
located in the '~/Projects' directory:

First we'll create a Sink link database:

>    cd ~/Projects/mywebapp ; sink -l init

we then create the links to the css files we want to borrow from 'mycsslibs':

>    sink -l add ~/Projects/mycsslib/base.css .
>    sink -l add ~/Projects/mycsslib/mycsslibs.css .
>    sink -l add ~/Projects/mycsslib/sidebarlayout.css .

now you can check the status of your links (did you do local changes, did the
original file changed ?)

>    sink -l status

you can pull changes from the source (meaning updating the 'mywebapp' CSS files
according to the 'mycsslibs' files)

>    sink -l pull

or push your local changes to the source (meaning updating the 'mycsslibs' CSS files
according to the 'mywebapp' local version)

>    sink -l push

I'll write it if you ask for it :)
